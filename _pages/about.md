"Infiltrator's Hideout" is an Offensive Security blog that was created as a platform for publishing personal works related to Cybersecurity domain as well as sharing knowledge and passion with my fellow Hackermen (which is a way of giving back to the community I have absorbed incredible knowledge from). Initially, among my publications you will be able to find my modest researches as well as CTF walkthroughs. As my hacking powers grow, the quality of publications will improve. If any of them catch your interest, feel free to submit your feedback or questions in the comments (as soon as I manage to enable comments on "super customizable" Jekyll) or, in case you've truly enjoyed it, you can leave me a "respect" on my HackTheBox profile.

Happy Hacking!
